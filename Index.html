        <h2>Early Life &amp; Origins</h2>
        <p>
          As a baby, Goku was sent to Earth with a destructive mission, but a head injury changed everything.
          Raised by Grandpa Gohan in the mountains, he grew into a kind-hearted kid who loved
          martial arts. Meeting Bulma kicked off his first Dragon Ball adventure, and training under
          Master Roshi gave him the basics that shaped his future. It’s simple: he kept showing up,
          kept learning, and kept getting better—little by little, then all at once.

        <h2>Legendary Battles &amp; Breakthroughs</h2>
        <p>
          Through foes like Vegeta, Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu, Goku’s mindset stayed the same:
          improve, adapt, and protect. Winning matters, but what really drives him is testing his limits.
          Many of his biggest leaps, like the first time he went Super Saiyan, came when he was pushed
          to the edge. That mix of curiosity and grit is why he keeps saving Earth… and sometimes the
          whole universe. <em>Power with purpose</em> sums him up well.
